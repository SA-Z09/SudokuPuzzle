# SudokuPuzzle

This is a project i did when i was learning Python 

So basically I wanted to represent a sudoku pattern

[[x00, x01, x02, x03... x08],
 [x10, x11, x12, x13... x18],
 .
 .
 .
 [x80, x81, x82, x83... x88]]


These row column values correspond to the value at the rth row, cth column. 
Lets start with 0.
If this values are empty(-1)
